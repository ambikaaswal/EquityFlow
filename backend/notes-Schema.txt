    //1. mlSuggestion: ['HOLD', 'SELL', 'BUY_MORE']:

🤖 What your AI recommends for each stock you own:

- HOLD: "Keep your current position, don't change anything"
  - Stock is fairly valued or uncertain market conditions
  - Example: You own 10 AAPL shares → AI says "HOLD" → Keep 10 shares

- SELL: "Exit this position, take profits or cut losses"  
  - Stock is overvalued or company fundamentals declining
  - Example: You own 5 TSLA shares → AI says "SELL" → Sell all 5 shares

- BUY_MORE: "Increase your position, stock has more upside"
  - Stock is undervalued or strong growth expected
  - Example: You own 2 RELIANCE → AI says "BUY_MORE" → Buy 3 more shares


    //2. riskScore: 1-10 scale:
📊 How risky this particular holding is:

1-3: Low Risk (Blue chip stocks, stable companies)
     - Example: TCS = 2 (stable IT giant)
     
4-6: Medium Risk (Growth stocks, cyclical companies)  
     - Example: RELIANCE = 5 (oil prices affect it)
     
7-10: High Risk (Volatile stocks, small companies)
      - Example: KPITTECH = 8 (small cap, volatile)

💡 Use Case: "Don't auto-trade high risk stocks without user approval"



    //3. performancePrediction: Expected % return:
📈 AI's prediction of how much profit/loss you'll make:

- +15.5 = AI expects 15.5% profit in next 6 months
- -8.2 = AI expects 8.2% loss, maybe suggest selling
- +2.1 = AI expects small 2.1% gain, maybe just hold

💡 Example: 
   You paid ₹100 per share
   AI predicts +20% return
   Expected price = ₹120 per share



    //4. confidence: 0-1 scale:
🎯 How sure the AI is about its prediction:

0.9-1.0: Very confident (90-100% sure)
         - "Strong technical indicators align"
         
0.7-0.8: Moderately confident (70-80% sure)  
         - "Most indicators positive, some uncertainty"
         
0.3-0.6: Low confidence (30-60% sure)
         - "Mixed signals, proceed with caution"
         
0.0-0.2: Very uncertain (0-20% sure)
         - "Don't auto-trade, too much uncertainty"

💡 Use Case: Only auto-execute trades with confidence > 0.7



    //5. autoRebalance: true/false:
⚖️ Should AI automatically adjust this holding?

true: "Yes, let AI buy/sell to maintain optimal portfolio balance"
      - User trusts AI with this stock
      - Low risk stock they're comfortable automating
      
false: "No, require manual approval for any changes"  
       - High risk stock
       - User wants control over this specific holding
       - Sentimental value (family company stock)

💡 Example: User enables autoRebalance for TCS but not for a penny stock



    //6. lastMLUpdate: Date tracking:
⏰ When did AI last analyze this stock?

- Ensures predictions aren't stale
- "Last updated 2 hours ago" vs "Last updated 3 days ago"
- Helps you know if data is fresh for decision making

💡 Use Case: Don't trade on predictions older than 4 hours



    //7. mlVersion: "v1.2" tracking:
🔧 Which AI model version made this prediction?

- "prophet_v1.0" = Basic forecasting model
- "prophet_v2.1" = Improved model with sentiment analysis  
- "ensemble_v1.0" = Combined multiple ML models

💡 Use Case: When you improve your ML models, you can track which 
predictions came from which version for performance comparison
